# PATRONUShCHARM
 This charm is a defensive spell which will
conjure a spirit guardian of their positive
emotions to defend against dark creatures;
it can also send messages to other witches
or wizards. The Patronus takes the form of
an animal, unique to each person who casts
it. The form of a Patronus can change when
one has undergone a period of heightened
emotion.
