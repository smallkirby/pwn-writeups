## pwn-writeups  
Collection of pwn challenges.  
Basically, all of the challs are solved by me, though the writeup might be based on the author's writeup or others' ones.
In most cases, exploit code is named `exploit.py` for userland challs.
For kernelland challs, there are two directories named `clone` and `work`. The former is the copy of the chall and the latter is the working directory, which contains exploit code named `exploit.c`.
